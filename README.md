## Josie Paris - Ecological Genomics 🐠🐟🐡🦞🐝🐧🦎
### Hello! 👋 I'm a postdoctoral researcher based at the University of L'Aquila, Italy

I'm interested in using analytical approaches in ecological genomics to integrate knowledge of adaptation into understanding the dynamics of wild animal populations. You can find out more about my research on my Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Z2-h0oIAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate
